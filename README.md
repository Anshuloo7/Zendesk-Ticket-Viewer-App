# Zendesk-Ticket-Viewer-App
A simple CLI App made using node.js as a part of Zendesk's assessment.
I've used the npm module inquirer.js, to restrict users from giving invalid inputs in the terminal and thus having more control over the application.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install NodeJs locally.
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Go to Zendesk-Ticket-Viewer-App folder. (package.json file is located here)
4. Run the following command, to install node modules/dependencies locally

`npm install`

5. Go to config.js File and change the subdomain, username & password as token (Optional)

6. Run the following command to run the application

`node app.js`
